## 📖 Overview

**AI News Trader** is a sophisticated Telegram bot that bridges the gap between raw chart data and AI-driven news analysis. Unlike standard scrapers, it uses a **hybrid approach**:

1.  **Technical Engine (Python):** Calculates exact support levels, detects "3-3-3" reversal patterns, and monitors 52-week high drops using `yfinance` and `scipy`.
2.  **Fundamental Engine (Gemini 2.5 Pro):** Parses specific URL contexts (News/Earnings reports) to explain *why* a move is happening and validates technical targets against analyst consensus.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🧠 Intelligent "3-3-3" Reversal Detection
Instead of random buying, the bot looks for a specific high-probability setup:
* **Trend:** At least 3 consecutive days of lower lows (The Fall).
* **Signal:** A "Reversal Candle" where Close > Yesterday's High.
* **Confirmation:** Volume analysis to confirm institutional interest.

### 2. 📉 "Best Buy" Limit Calculator
* Uses `scipy.signal.argrelextrema` to find historical support levels (valleys).
* Automatically suggests a **Limit Order price** below the CMP (Current Market Price) to catch wicks.

### 3. 📰 Gemini 2.5 Pro Integration
* **URL Context:** You pass a link (MoneyControl, TradingView, Google Finance), and the AI "reads" the page to extract news.
* **FUT Target:** Generates a 30-day "Future Target" based on the merged Technical + Fundamental view.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** Python 3.10+
* **Data Science:** `yfinance`, `pandas`, `pandas_ta`, `scipy`, `numpy`
* **AI:** `google-genai` (Gemini 2.5 Pro with Search & URL Tools)
* **Bot Interface:** `python-telegram-bot` (Async)
* **Deployment:** Flask + Gunicorn (for Webhook)

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/saranshML/ai-news-trader.git](https://github.com/saranshML/ai-news-trader.git)
cd ai-news-trader
2. Install Requirements
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

Code snippet

TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SECRET_TOKEN=optional_secret_for_webhook_security
🏃 Usage
Start the Bot
Run the main application (ensure you are on a VPS or local machine with Python installed):

Bash

python main.py
Telegram Commands
/analyze <TICKER> target <URL>
The flagship command that performs the hybrid analysis.

Example:

Plaintext

/analyze KAYNES target [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/KAYNES:NSE](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/KAYNES:NSE)
Bot Response:

KAYNES Analysis 📉 Drop Context: Stock fell 12% due to delayed semiconductor plant approval (Source: URL). 🛑 Technical Setup: 3-3-3 Reversal Detected (High Strength). 💰 Buy Zone: ₹4,850 - ₹4,900 (Major Support). 🚀 FUT Target: ₹5,600 (Rebound to 50 EMA expected).

☁️ Deployment (Cloudflare + VPS)
Since scipy and pandas are too heavy for serverless functions (like Cloudflare Workers), this project uses a Proxy Architecture:

Cloudflare Worker (worker.js): Receives the Telegram Webhook -> Protects IP -> Forwards to VPS.

VPS (Render/Heroku/DigitalOcean): Runs the heavy Python code (main.py).

Deploying the Cloudflare Worker
Copy the code from worker.js.

Create a new Worker in Cloudflare Dashboard.

Add Environment Variables: PYTHON_BACKEND_URL (Your VPS URL) and SECRET_TOKEN.
